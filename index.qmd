# Introduction

In this project we aim to visualize the trends of the most frequently used babynames from 1880 to 2017 in the United States. We do this by:

-   Understanding the different columns of the data set
-   Find the top 10 most frequently used baby names in the data for:
    -   girls
    -   boys
-   Plot the yearly trend of the top 10 baby names
